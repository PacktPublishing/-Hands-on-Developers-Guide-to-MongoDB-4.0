MongoDB is one of the best database management systems out there for large applications. It makes data easy to work with. Ad hoc queries, indexing, and a robust aggregation framework provides powerful ways to access and analyze your data. 

This course will help you become proficient in using MongoDB for your applications and handling its data. We’ll take a test-driven approach to the NodeJS environment with Jest to explore all the features that MongoDB has to offer. Throughout the course, we’ll build a taxi aggregator database, simulate real-world challenges, and solve them with MongoDB.
